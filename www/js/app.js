,"zhf_34":"is rarely encountered in hundreds and thousands of kalpas,"
,"zhf_35":"now receiving this transmission and blessing,"
,"zhf_36":"I vow to penetrate the true meaning of Tathagata."
,"zhf_37":"The Sutra of Authentic Dharma that Removes Hindrances and Bestows Good Fortune, "
,"zhf_38":"spoken by Living Buddha Lian-sheng:"
,"zhf_39":"Thus have I heard. At one time, White Mahapadmakumara was present at the Maha Twin Lotus Ponds, sitting upon the great white lotus dharma-throne; surrounding Him were seventeen other great lotus blossoms. The Green Lotus radiated green light, the Yellow Lotus yellow light, the Red Lotus red light, the Purple Lotus purple light. Each lotus blossom was mysteriously wonderful, pure, and full of fragrance."
,"zhf_40":"The White Padmakumara, silently calling forth his spiritual power, transformed the Maha Twin Lotus Ponds into an extraordinarily splendid place filled with golden light. All the flower-buds simultaneously burst into fragrant blossoms. Jade grasses sent forth a wonderful scent. White cranes, peacocks, parrots, saris, kalavinkas, and jivajiras all took on a golden hue, and sang graceful heavenly songs in harmony."
,"zhf_41":"The sky filled with golden light. A pure and wonderful heavenly melody resounded from the sky. The fragrances suffused all realms. Golden sky-abodes, adorned throughout with golden lotuses, radiated splendor. From the sky there showered heavenly flowers."
,"zhf_42":"At that moment, the ground shook violently in Maha Twin Lotus Ponds and throughout countless heavens the tremors could be felt. Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Sound-Hearers all felt it as well and came to Maha Twin Lotus Ponds, as did the rulers of all the Thirty-three Heavens. The assembly included beings from the Twenty-eight Heavens, Lords Indra and Brahma, the eight classes of supernatural beings, and the Fourfold Sangha, all of whom came to hear the revelation of quintessential teaching."
,"zhf_43":"At that moment, the Golden Padmakumara emitted the Great Wisdom Light. The White Padmakumara emitted the Dharma Realm Light. The Green Padmakumara emitted the Ten Thousand Treasure Light. The Black Padmakumara emitted the Subjugation Light, Red Padmakumara the Vow Light, Purple Padmakumara the Proper and Dignified Light, Blue Padmakumara the Virtuous Fruit Light, Yellow Padmakumara the Fortune Fulfilling Light, and the Orange Padmakumara emitted the Child Innocence Light."
,"zhf_44":"Upon seeing this, all the heavenly beings were greatly awed. Then Indra arose from his seat and, joining his palms to White Padmakumara, said, `This is most rare, O Holy and Revered One. By what cause does the Maha Twin Lotus Ponds emit such great light and splendor?`"
,"zhf_45":"White Mahapadmakumara said, `I will expound upon this for everyone present.` Indra said, `The Holy Revered One is the most mighty and powerful. Please explain to everyone present, that all Men and Devas may know where to turn.`"
,"zhf_46":"At that moment, White Mahapadmakumara addressed Indra and the assembly as follows: `Very well, very well. I will now explain to you and all the beings of the last period of this Buddha-kalpa, and all those in the future who have an affinity with the sutra, that all may know the True Buddha Dharma and the principle which removes obstacles and bestows good fortune.`White Mahapadmakumara then said, `All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have, in order to liberate living beings, manifested the worlds known as `All-Conquering,` `Wonderful Treasure,` `Round Pearl,` `Sorrowless,` `Pure Rest,` `Dharma Thought,` `Full Moon,` `Profound Joy,` `Profound Completeness,` `Lotus,` `Immutable,` and `Omnipresence.` Now, there shall be the `True Buddha World.``"
,"zhf_47":"Thus the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Sound-Hearers, Solitary-Buddhas, and all the heavenly beings witnessed the Holy Revered One bringing forth the True Buddha World, understanding it to be a manifestation of the cause and fruition of great compassion of the auspicious Well-departed Ones of the past, present, and future, and realizing that the Holy Revered One came for the sake of all beings. All present were moved by joy as never before. Then bowing their heads they made praise with these verses:"
,"zhf_48":"The Holy Revered One of great compassion, the Secret One who is most supreme,"
,"zhf_49":"had attained Enlightenment in the past,and transcended all worldly passions."
,"zhf_50":"He now establishes the True Buddha World,showering compassion on all living beings."
,"zhf_51":"Transforming Himself into a Pure Land founding Buddha,He descends into the Saha World."
,"zhf_52":"With Lian-sheng as His name, He announces and proclaims the Dharma to all."
,"zhf_53":"We have all now heard and shall vow to protect and uphold His Dharma."
,"zhf_54":"At that moment, the holy revered White Mahapadmakumara instructed the assembly, saying `In cultivation, the key to realizing the Buddha Jewel Sambodhi is a quiescent mind; that of realizing the Dharma Jewel is purity of body, speech, and mind; that of realizing the Sangha Jewel is refuge in a True Buddha Guru.`"
,"zhf_55":"The Holy Revered One further instructed the assembly, saying `If good men or women, on the eighteenth day of the fifth month of each lunar year, make ablution, abstain from flesh, and wear new and clean clothes, or on the eighteenth day of each lunar month, or on their own birthdays, call upon the Two Buddhas and Eight Bodhisattvas before the shrine, and reverently recite this Sutra of Authentic Dharma that Removes Hindrances and Bestows Good Fortune, then their supplications will be answered. Moreover, if incense, flowers, lamps, tea and fruit are offered, along with sincere prayer, then all wishes will be granted.`"
,"zhf_56":"The Holy Revered One told the assembly, `People of this saha world, be they high officials, nobility, renunciates, householders, yogis, or common folk, who, upon learning of this sutra, uphold, read and recite it, shall prosper above all others, have greater lifespan, obtain either a son or daughter as sought, and be blessed with measureless fortune. This is indeed a great fortune-bestowing sutra for obtaining blessings."
,"zhf_57":"`One may have deceased ancestors, enemies, close ones or creditors who are unable to obtain liberation and remain lost in the nether world. However, by upholding, reciting, printing and propagating this sutra, the deceased will ascend to heaven, enemies will be turned away, and those living will be blessed. If there be man or woman seized by negative forces or afflicted by spirits, or confused and haunted by nightmares, then, by upholding, printing and propagating this sutra, all negative influences shall be banished, thereby restoring peace and ease."
,"zhf_58":"`If one suffers the physical retribution of illness and calamity, whether due to non-virtuous body karma from previous lives or to the afflictions of spirits, then, by holding, reciting, printing and propagating this sutra, ill omens will immediately disappear and the cause of illness will quickly be removed. If one suffers from misfortune, legal entanglement or imprisonment, then, upon holding, reciting, printing and propagating this sutra, all such obstacles will dissolve immediately, and calamity will be vanquished and turned into auspiciousness."
,"zhf_59":"`Should nations enter into war, then whoever holds this sutra and creates an image of Padmakumara, setting up offerings before it, immediately receives extra prowess wherein no battle can be lost. Those who recite, print, or propagate this sutra will receive every good fortune, just as they desire. All hindrances will be removed, and the sufferings of the cycle of birth and death will be extinguished.`"
,"zhf_60":"Then, in the Western True Buddha Assembly at the Maha Twin Lotus Ponds, White Mahapadmakumara proclaimed this mantra:"
,"zhf_61":"`Om, Guru, Lian-sheng Siddhi, Hum.` "
,"zhf_62":"When the Holy Revered One completed this discourse, Indra and the whole assembly, including devas, nagas, and the rest of the eight classes of supernatural beings, and the Fourfold Sangha all paid reverence. They brought forth faith and upheld the teaching. Thus ends the Sutra of Authentic Dharma that Removes Hindrances and Bestows Good Fortune."
